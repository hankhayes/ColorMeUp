## About
OrgSync is a student organization management application. It aims to give student organizations an easy way to manage their members, send announcements, and plan events.
## Dependencies
- Swift version: `Apple Swift Version 5.9`
- Xcode version: `15.0.1 (15A507)`
- iOS Deployment target: `17.0`

Sample data for members, events, and announcements have been already created. There's no need to launch multiple simulators, but if you'd like to see the Firebase Realtime Database in action, this would be the best way to do so. 

> Registering as a new user will give you "member" privileges, so you will not be able to do things like create announcements or events.
## Usage
OrgSync is built on top of a FireBase Realtime Database, which allows students to create their own membership account. Announcements and events that are created in the app are actually viewable on other devices at the time of creation.
> There are a few parts of this app that I started building and have not completed. All core project requirements are fulfilled but you may encounter an occasional bug or unfinished section.
